 * [TODO]
 *
 *  Hardware
 * ----------
 *
 * + energy performance counters
 *
 * + kernel module : to reduce cpu usage near to 0.01%
 *     using mmap to transfer the complete RO data structure to userland.
 *     compute the best idle sleep time.
 *     change from "pull" to "push" with a "data is ready" event.
 *
 * + memory fetch : to remove dependancies with the dmi_sysfs & msr Linux modules.
 *     using a R/O mmap to "/dev/mem".
 *     base clock is a 2 bytes word found at address 0xf08d9 + 0x12 (Rampage II GENE).
 *     rather use the msr assembler instruction.
 *
 * + GPU sensors.
 *     compile with the NVIDIA (first), the AMD & Intel frameworks (seconds) ?
 *
 * + other processors ...
 *
 * + procstat
 *
 *  Graphical
 * -----------
 *
 * + a new energy Widget.
 * + some button-switchs & sliders to enable/disable/set the PKG/Core features in the System Info Widget.
 * + full transparency & opacity.
 * + integrate XCB, wayland ?
 * + handle skins :
 *     second layout should provide processor usage history.
 *     compute which core have the longest usage (displayed as the App title name).
 * + manage others XEvent : close, move, resize, etc.
 * + gradiant coloring.
 * + screenshot key.
 * + mouse handling.
 *
 *
 *  Source code
 * -------------
 * + clean makefile : remove my previous Raspberry instructions.
 * + clang compliant : rewrite code to remove any "warning: use of GNU old-style ..."
 * + provide some configure and install scripts.
 *
 *
 *   Issues
 * ----------
 * + Cores rarely reach Turbo ratios : working on the Performance Counters.
 *
 *
 * [HISTORY]
 *
 * R 0.16 : 01/29 2014
 *        - Read the TSC per logical Core using IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER(0x10) rather than RDTSC instruction.
 *        - Integrate the Misc Processor Features into the System Info Widget. See IA32_MISC_ENABLE(0x1a0).
 *        - Attempt to handle the temperature Threshold values with IA32_THERM_INTERRUPT(0x19b) : no data !
 *
 * R 0.15 : 01/28 2014 SR-4
 *        - Reorganized the time critical part in the uCycle thread.
 *        - Reduced the CPU overhead in Events loop and the Drawing thread.
 *
 * R 0.15 : 01/24 2014 SR-3
 *        - Cosmetic changes with the MDI window. Use '-D 1' to enable the MDI.
 *        - Minimizing or unmapping a widget stops its drawing.
 *        - The command argument '-D' enables the Multiple Document Interface management mode.
 *        - The Widgets are now gracefully disposed.
 *        - Added an architecture table with default processors values.
 *        - Implemented the C3 and C6 C-States counters.
 *        - Create 2 new Widgets:
 *            C-States per Core and in Processor average.
 *            Temperature per Core and hottest.
 *        - Protect the drawing thread with a mutex.
 *        - Scroll the Processor brand name (Wallboard).
 *        - Changed the action associated with [Page Down] & [Page Up] keys.
 *        - The [+] and [-] keys of the NumPad allow to decrase or increase the idle time.
 *        - In the Core Widget :
 *            the [H] key hide / unhide the frequencies.
 *            the [P] key hide / unhide the C-States counters.
 *        - The System Information Widget now gathers all detail about Processor, RAM and BIOS.
 *
 * R 0.14 : 01/19 2014
 *        - Added the option '-c' to monitor the processor either per threads, either per cores.
 *        - The Cores load is now based on the C0 performance counter and relatively to the TSC.
 *
 * R 0.13 : 01/14 2014 SR-1
 *        - The program is changed from 2 to 3 threads:
 *            uCycle to compute the actual frequency.
 *            uDraw to paint the foreground.
 *            uLoop to handle X events. (called by the main thread)
 *        - The calculation of the Cores frequency is now as follow :
 *            (Base Operating Ratio) x (Delta of Unhalted Cycles) x (Bus CLOCK frequency)
 *
 * R 0.12 : 01/14 2014
 *        - Use the MSR performance counters to provide a better computation accuracy of the Cores frequency multiplier.
 *        - Intel Core Architecture detected.
 *        - Blink yellow when in pause mode.
 *
 * R 0.11 : 01/09 2014
 *        - add specifications pages for Processor (features), RAM (timings & channels count) and BIOS (BCLK).
 *            press [F1] to get help and scroll with arrow keys.
 *        - provide a compact string for processor brand.
 *        - better font support.
 *            layout scaling is based on loaded font.
 *            "fixed" font as a default.
 *
 * R 0.10 : 01/04 2014
 *        - the MSR readings are optimized a little bit, however turbo ratios don't show up yet.
 *        - drawing is now done with 2 pixmaps :
 *            B, for the background layout,
 *            F, to display the dynamics.
 *        - the event loop does not sleep anymore but waits for any event on the socket.
 *        - the '-a' argument allows to show the activity of the loop.
 *        - transparency only works with a composite manager.
 *        - the project is ported to Code::Blocks, however not delivered yet.
 *        - semaphore lock is still questioned ?
 * R 0.09 : 01/01 2014
 *        - PAUSE key to suspend drawing.
 *        - double buffering.
 *        - pseudo transparency with any window id (see option -D[esktop]).
 *        - read SMBIOS @ 0x24 to get the true number of active Core threads (instead of CPUID).
 *        - some drawing alignment; text scaling; coloring based on the ratios.
 *        - add the temperature & a few spaces in the application title name.
 *        - inform the WM of the Widget fixed size : no resize faisable.
 *        - new option -s to set the idle time (micro-seconds) inside function uExec().
 *        - leave Event Loop, uLoop() as the main thread.
 * R 0.08 : Widget ready as a beta release.
 * R 0.01 to 0.07 : initial source code.
