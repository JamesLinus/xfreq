 * | 2- Insert or modprobe the Kernel modules : dmi_sysfs (optional) and msr (mandatory) |
 * | 3- Allow root access to the X Server (with the xhost + command for instance)        |
 * +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 *
 * 4- depending of your packages distribution, the libraries required to compile the source code are the following
 *
 * XLIB developer (libX11)
 *
 * POSIX threads (pthreads)
 *
 *
 *
 * [RUN]
 *
 * 1- the following kernel modules and file systems are prerequisites to run XFreq
 *
 * +---------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+
 * | msr.ko                    | mandatory | model specific registers (1)         |
 * +---------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+
 * | dmi-sysfs.ko              | optional  | DMI tables (2)                       |

 *
 *
 * 2- if already logged into an X session as a regular user, you may have to disable the X ACL using one of this two solutions.
 *
 * 'xhost +'
 * or
 * './bin/xfreq -a N'
 *
 *
 * 3- then as root start XFreq
 *
 * ./bin/xfreq
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *   some DE, such as KDE, provides their all-in-one launcher which simplify the previous steps (2 & 3)
 *   try 'kdesu ./bin/xfreq'

 * [ISSUE]
 *
 * + The live CD is too big (more than 500 MB).
 *     So I packed other benchmark tools inside ;-)
 *
 * + The temperature thresholds MSR does not return any value.
 *     Need to investigate ACPI.
 *
 * + Program freeze after a long run. Probably due to a semaphore lock overload. So far limited to Core2
 *
 * + Fast-Strings reported as not available in CPUID but enabled in MSR.
 *
 * + Ponctual memory leak related to XrmDatabase is reported by Valgrind.
 *
 *
 *
 * [TODO]
 *
 *  Hardware
 * ----------
 *
 * + power energy performance counters
 *
 * + kernel module : to reduce cpu usage near to 0.01%
 *     using mmap to transfer the complete RO data structure to userland.
 *     compute the best idle sleep time.
 *     change from "pull" to "push" with a "data is ready" event.
 *
 * + memory fetch : to remove dependancies with the dmi_sysfs & msr Linux modules.
 *     using a R/O mmap to "/dev/mem".
 *     rather use the msr assembler instruction.
 *
 * + GPU sensors.
 *     compile with the NVIDIA (first), the AMD & Intel frameworks (seconds) ?
 *
 * + scripting, editor, push alarms : write user defined bit values in MSR.
 *
 *
 *  Graphical
 * -----------
 *
 * + power energy Widget using a slider to:
 *     select a Policy Preference in IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS , MSR_MISC_PWR_MGMT(0x1aa),
 *     set On-Demand Clock Modulation in IA32_CLOCK_MODULATION(0x19a) (duplicated for each Thread),
 *     enable / disable C1E in MSR_POWER_CTL(0x1fc),
 *     C-State auto demotion with MSR_PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL(0xe2).
 * + some button-switchs & sliders to enable/disable/set the PKG/Core features in the System Info Widget.
 * + full transparency & opacity.
 * + integrate XCB, wayland ?
 * + handle skins : Done. Colors only.
 * + provide a processor usage history : In progress.
 * + gradiant coloring.
 * + screenshot key.
 * + resize footer separator w/ MDI.
 * + discrete temperature graphic: per CPU.
 *
 *
 *  Source code
 * -------------
 * + clang compliant : rewrite code to remove any "warning: use of GNU old-style ..."
 * + provide some configure and install scripts, especially an ArchLinux PKGBUILD : In progress.
 * + split the code between GUI and hardware parts : postponed R 2.00
 * + release candidate.

 * R 0.28 : 05/26/2014 SR-1
 *        - Fixed some typos.
 *
 * R 0.28 : 05/26/2014 SR-0

 *        - Enhanced the '-i' option with a Splash attributes argument which allows to hide the Window and to defer the startup time.
 *        - Changed the bit field tests to avoid a potential stack overflow.
 *
 * R 0.27 : 05/24/2014 SR-2
 *        - While reinforcing integer data type variables, then scanning for errors with Valgrind, raised a duplicated definition of 'Status'
 *            with the header file X11/Xlib.h. Thus in the THERM_STATUS structure, the field has been renamed to 'StatusBit'.

 *        - Removed the '-x' and '-y' arguments which were used to set the initial position of the MAIN Widget.
 *        - Allow to sort the task monitoring using the '-t' option followed by the field number.
 *            argument is like 0x{R}0{N} from [0x000 / 0x101 .. 0x10b]
 *              where {R} to reverse sorting and {N} is the field number in the /proc/sched_debug file.

 *            '-t' was a duplicate and has been replaced by '-o' to keep Widgets always on top;
 *            '-t' to boot the task scheduling monitor is now correctly saved into the settings file.
 *
 * R 0.25 : 04/30/2014 SR-2
 *        - When pressed, flash buttons with the COLOR_PULSE during a usleep of 50000.

 *        - The [+] and [-] keys of the NumPad allow to decrase or increase the idle time.
 *        - In the Core Widget :
 *            the [H] key hide / unhide the frequencies.
 *            the [P] key hide / unhide the C-States counters.
 *        - The System Information Widget now gathers all detail about Processor, RAM and BIOS.
 *
 * R 0.14 : 01/19 2014
 *        - Added the option '-c' to monitor the processor either per threads, either per cores.
 *        - The Cores load is now based on the C0 performance counter and relatively to the TSC.
 *
 * R 0.13 : 01/14 2014 SR-1
 *        - The program is changed from 2 to 3 threads:
 *            uCycle to compute the actual frequency.
 *            uDraw to paint the foreground.
 *            uLoop to handle X events. (called by the main thread)
 *        - The calculation of the Cores frequency is now as follow :
 *            (Base Operating Ratio) x (Delta of Unhalted Cycles) x (Bus CLOCK frequency)
 *
 * R 0.12 : 01/14 2014
 *        - Use the MSR performance counters to provide a better computation accuracy of the Cores frequency multiplier.
 *        - Intel Core Architecture detected.
 *        - Blink yellow when in pause mode.
 *
 * R 0.11 : 01/09 2014
 *        - add specifications pages for Processor (features), RAM (timings & channels count) and BIOS (BCLK).
 *            press [F1] to get help and scroll with arrow keys.
 *        - provide a compact string for processor brand.
 *        - better font support.
 *            layout scaling is based on loaded font.
 *            "fixed" font as a default.
 *
 * R 0.10 : 01/04 2014
 *        - the MSR readings are optimized a little bit, however turbo ratios don't show up yet.
 *        - drawing is now done with 2 pixmaps :
 *            B, for the background layout,
 *            F, to display the dynamics.
 *        - the event loop does not sleep anymore but waits for any event on the socket.
 *        - the '-a' argument allows to show the activity of the loop.
 *        - transparency only works with a composite manager.
 *        - the project is ported to Code::Blocks, however not delivered yet.
 *        - semaphore lock is still questioned ?
 * R 0.09 : 01/01 2014
 *        - PAUSE key to suspend drawing.
 *        - double buffering.
 *        - pseudo transparency with any window id (see option -D[esktop]).
 *        - read SMBIOS @ 0x24 to get the true number of active Core threads (instead of CPUID).
 *        - some drawing alignment; text scaling; coloring based on the ratios.
 *        - add the temperature & a few spaces in the application title name.
 *        - inform the WM of the Widget fixed size : no resize faisable.
 *        - new option -s to set the idle time (micro-seconds) inside function uExec().
 *        - leave Event Loop, uLoop() as the main thread.
 * R 0.08 : Widget ready as a beta release.
 * R 0.01 to 0.07 : initial source code.
