 * TODO
 * 
 *  Hardware
 * ----------
 * 
 * + kernel module : to reduce cpu usage near to 0.01%
 *     using mmap to transfer the complete RO data structure to userland.
 *     compute the best idle sleep time.
 *     change from "pull" to "push" with a "data is ready" event.
 * 
 * + memory fetch : to remove dependancies with the dmi_sysfs & msr Linux modules.
 *     using a R/O mmap to "/dev/mem".
 *     base clock is a 2 bytes word found at address 0xf08d9 + 0x12 (Rampage II GENE).
 *     rather use the msr assembler instruction.
 * 
 * + provide a better processor brand string.
 *     a more compact string which will be included in the app header.
 *     avoid a processor references table to less maintain source code.
 *
 * + re-use any work I've done or started in coremod.c
 *     some SMBIOS structures.
 *     DDR timings & channels count.
 *     on-fly overclocking.
 *
 * + GPU sensors.
 *     compile with the NVIDIA (first), the AMD & Intel frameworks (seconds) ?
 * 
 * + other processors ...
 *
 * 
 *  Graphical
 * -----------
 * 
 * + full transparency & opacity.
 * + remove the window decoration.
 * + optimize the event loop & reduce the number of Xlib calls.
 * + integrate XCB, wayland ?
 * + handle skins : 
 *     second layout should provide processor usage history.
 *     compute which core have the longest usage (displayed as the App title name).
 * + provide mutex : between the uExec & uLoop threads.
 * + manage others XEvent : close, move, resize, etc.
 * + better fonts support :
 *     especially when none supplied.
 *     layout scaling.
 * + compatibilty with Xsession & any DE greeters.
 *
 *
 *  Source code
 * -------------
 * + clean makefile : remove my previous Raspberry instructions.
 * + clang compliant : rewrite code to remove any "warning: use of GNU old-style ..."
 * + provide some configure and install scripts.
 * 
 * 
 * HISTORY
 * 
 * R 0.09 : transparency in progress.
 * R 0.08 : Widget ready as a beta release.
